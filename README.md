# evcharging_FRI

Building Deep Reinforcement Learning model to optimize the placement of EV Charging stations in various counties of New York. Placement optimization is based on demand at location (which is computed using a supervised learning model) and total coverage. The Deep RL model is in the Deep Q Learning file, and the supervised model is in the supervisedmodel_training file. The methods and results code review files mark two major timepoints in the project.
